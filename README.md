# PacmanPathfinder
The project is built with Java, and is a pathfinding algorithm that makes Pacman solve different types of mazes by applying breadth first search and depth first search strategies. The program finds a path from one location to another in any enclosed field of obstacles, and compares the results to determine which delivers the shortest path. 
In an effort to bridge and understanding between atonal music and the tress/graphs data structure in computer science, I wanted to fully understand how graph traversal algorithm worked by visualizing it in a maze. Since there is no one way to traverse a graph, provided there is a path, the same can be said with the style of atonal music. Many people have a hard time understanding atonal music, as the melody isn't always quite as obvious as one would listen to Mozart or Beethoven for example. No one fully understands it until the end, and many may never understand, although acts as if they do. This is similar to how in traversing a graph, any starting point may be valid. Furthermore, one cannot replay a note until all of the twelve tones have been played. This is similar to depth first search, where the graph is traversed to the youngest node, before traversing from a different edge. Completing this project made me realize the potential similarities with computer science and music.
